# semantic-segmentation-for-self-driving-cars
We build a modified U-Net model which is different from the original model described
in the UNet paper, by introducing the mish activation function since the mish activation was found
to outperform the ReLU activation in deep convolutional neural networks, the
modified model also uses instance normalization since it was found to be useful
in a similar application
